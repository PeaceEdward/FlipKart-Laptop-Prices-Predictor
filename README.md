# FlipKart-Laptop-Prices-Predictor

**Executive Summary**

This project aims to develop a predictive system for laptop prices on the Flipkart e-commerce platform, enabling optimized pricing strategies. The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately forecast future product prices based on historical data and extracted features.

To accurately predict future product prices, a machine learning model is built and trained on the processed historical data and extracted features. This predictive model leverages advanced algorithms and techniques to capture the complex relationships between product attributes and price dynamics.

A key component of this project is the extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted to gain insights into the data and identify patterns, trends, and relationships that informed the feature engineering and model development processes. The EDA involved:

1. Univariate Analysis: Conducted univariate analysis to explore the distribution and central tendencies of individual features, such as product specifications, historical prices, and other relevant variables.
2. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Employed bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques to investigate the relationships and correlations between different features, enabling the identification of potential predictors and interactions.
3. Visualization: Leveraged various data visualization techniques, including scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps, to visually represent the data and uncover hidden patterns and trends.

Other major achievements of this project include:

1. **Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction**: Developed a robust data cleaning pipeline that utilizes regular expressions (regex) to extract valuable features from unstructured text data, such as product descriptions and specifications.

2. **Data Integration and Preprocessing**: Developed data pipelines to integrate and preprocess the collected data, ensuring data quality, consistency, and suitability for model training.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Employed advanced feature engineering techniques to derive meaningful features from the product data, capturing relevant information for accurate price prediction.

4. **Model Development**: Built and trained a machine learning model using state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques to predict future product prices based on historical data and extracted features.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Conducted rigorous model evaluation using appropriate metrics and techniques to ensure the predictive model meets the desired accuracy and reliability standards.

6. **Pricing Strategy Optimization**: Provided insights and recommendations to optimize pricing strategies based on the predicted product prices, enabling businesses to make informed decisions and stay competitive in the e-commerce market.

The product price prediction system developed in this project has the potential to significantly impact pricing strategies and decision-making processes for businesses operating on the Flipkart e-commerce platform. By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, businesses can gain a competitive advantage, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance profitability while delivering value to customers.
